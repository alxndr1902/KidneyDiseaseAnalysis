ðŸ©º What is Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)?
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. Often developing silently over time, CKD may not show symptoms until it reaches advanced stages, making early detection critical.

It is commonly caused by conditions like:

Diabetes

Hypertension (high blood pressure)

Prolonged kidney inflammation or infections

Medical professionals assess CKD using indicators such as:

eGFR (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate) â€“ a measure of kidney function

Serum Creatinine & BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) â€“ waste levels in the blood

Left untreated, CKD can progress to kidney failure, requiring dialysis or a transplant. Early diagnosis helps manage the disease, slow its progression, and reduce health complications.
